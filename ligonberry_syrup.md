# Ligonberry Syrup

### Ingredients:

- 8oz frozen ligonberries
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 cup sugar

Place the ligonberries and the water into a small saucepan. Bring the water to a boil, stirring as it heats. Add the sugar, stirring until it dissolves.

Reduce the heat until it reaches a quiet simmer. Stir it as it simmers until about half the water boils off -- about 25 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the stove and cool it quickly; placing the saucepan in a larger bowl of icewater works well.
