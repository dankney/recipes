# Bread Machine Pasta Dough

### Ingredients:

- Four large eggs
- 2 1/2 cups unbleached, all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
 

Start by putting the eggs into the bread machine; make sure that the yolks are broken. Add the salt, flour, and olive-oil. Use the "Pasta" function if your bread machine has one. If not, use the dough function.

Once the "knead" and "rest" cycles are complete (about 20 minutes), remove though dough. Give it a couple of kneads by hand and let it rest for at least an hour before rolling it out.

You can roll it the next day if you wrap it in plastic and store it in the fridge.
