# Limoncello Cream Sauce

Ingredients:

- 4 lbs Compari, Cherry, or other sweet Tomatoes ("Tomatoes on the Vine")
- 3/4 cup Limoncello liquor
- 1 bunch basil
- 1/2 cup Sun Dried Tomatoes, packed in oil
- 1/2 cup pitted Kalamata Olives
- 1/3 cup Heavy Cream
- 1/4 cup olive oil

Chop the basil finely using a food processor. Mix the basil and Limoncello in a large bowl.

Peel the tomatoes by dipping them briefly in boiling water and removing skins. Add the peeled tomatoes to the bowl.

Once all of the tomatoes are added, give them a gentle mashing with a potato masher. You shouldn't decimate the tomatoes -- do just enough to mix the juices with the liquor & basil. There should be just enough liquid (limoncello/tomatoe juice mixture) to cover the tomatoes.

Cover the bowl and set it in the fridge to soak for an hour or so.

Put the sun dried tomatoes and kalamata olives in a food processor and blend until they form a tapenade. You should have about a half cup of tapenade -- add additional olives and tomatoes until it comes out with the right volume.

Sautee the tapenade in olive oil for about five minutes. Add the tomatoe/limoncello mixture including liquid and reduce on medium-low heat for about 2 hours or until most of the liquid has evaporated.

Add heavy cream and heat it to just shy of a boil, stirring constantly.

Serve over pasta -- I find this compliments a cheese Tortelini beautifully.
