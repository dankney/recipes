# Pesto Cream Sauce

### Ingredients:

- 3 Tablespoons Pesto
- 1 Pint Half & Half
- 1/4 cup freshly shredded Paremesan Cheese
- 1/2 teaspoon Black pepper

This is a 10-minute sauce that takes about as much time and effort as cooking the pasta.

Put coat the bottom of a medium pan with the pesto and set to medium-low heat. Add black pepper.

Once the pesto starts bubbling a little bit, stir in the half & half. Stir constantly as the sauce heats. Once it starts steaming a little, add the parmesan cheese. Continue stirring and heating until it barely starts to boil. Turn the heat off and give it a couple more stirs as the bubbling subsides and it's done.
