# Vegetarian Mongolian Beef

Serves 3-4 adults

### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon mined garlic
- 3/4 cup low-salt soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon vegetarian hoisin sauce
- 1/3 cup finely chopped cilantro
- 2-7 dried thai chili peppers
- 1 package Trader Joe's Beef-Less Strips
- One medium red bell pepper
- One small sweet onion

Mix the soy sauce, hoisin, garlic, and cilantro in a medium mixing bowl. Add the "meat" and dried chili peppers. Thoroughly coat the "meat" and let it soak for 5 minutes while you finish the prep.

As a general rule of thumb, start with two dried chili peppers for "one star" spice levels. Add a large chili pepper for each additional "star" you'd like.  This more or less approximates the spice scale for middle America. If you want authentic spicy, just go nuts with them.

Cut your onion in half. Chop one half finely and the other half coarsely. Chop the bell pepper coarsely.

Sautee the onion and bell pepper for about 5 minutes over medium heat; it should be just long enough for the onion to start to get soft. 

Add the sauce/meat mixture and simmer for about ten minutes or until the smaller bits of onion are mostly dissolved into the sauce.

Serve over rice.
