# Vegetarian Mongolian Beef

Serves 3-4 adults

### Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons mined garlic
- 2/3 cup low-salt soy sauce
- 1/3 cup mirin
- 1 tablespoon vegetarian hoisin sauce (optional)
- 1 tablespoon Sri Racha hotsauce
- 1 bunuch cilantro, finely chopped (split)
- 2-7 dried thai chili peppers
- 2 cups [Hearty Plant Protien Strips](https://www.amazon.com/Plant-Basics-Unflavored-Vegetarian-Substitute/dp/B07M8YMP7J)
- One large red bell pepper, coarsely chopped
- One medium white onion
- Two stalks of celery, coarsely chopped
- Three medium carrots, coarsely chopped

Mix the soy sauce, mirin, hoisin, one tablespoon garlic, Sri Racha, and half the cilantro in a medium mixing bowl. Add the plant protein. Thoroughly coat the protein and let it marinate for an hour in the fridge. Give it a stir every fifteen minutes or so to make sure the flavor is evenly absorbed by the protein.

Cut your onion in half. Chop one half finely and the other half coarsely.

Sautee the remaining garlic, onion, bell pepper, dried chili peppers, carrots, and celery for about 7 minutes over medium heat; it should be just long enough for the carrot to start to get soft. 

Add the sauce/meat mixture and simmer for about ten minutes or until the smaller bits of onion are mostly dissolved into the sauce. Add the remaining cilantro about halfway through. 

Serve over rice.
