# Yorkshire Pudding
**Serves Two**

Ingredients:

- Three Eggs
- 3/4 cup Flour
- 3/4 cup Milk
- Safflour Oil

Yorkshire pudding is traditionally served with a roast, cooked underneath it to catch the drippings from the meat. That's gross, though, so I serve it as a breakfast dish with butter and maple syrup.

There's a [specialized pan](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001IX44A/) that is absolutely worth using, but muffin tin will work as well.

To start, drizzle just enough safflour oil into each of the pan's wells to cover the bottom of each well. Put the pan into a convection oven set to 410F while it preheats -- you want the opil to be hot once the oven is at temperature.

Mix the eggs, milk, and flour into a thin batter. When the oven is preheated, pour the batter into each of the wells. 

Put it back into the oven for 20-25 minutes. It will puff up as it cooks and will be finished once it's lightly browned.
