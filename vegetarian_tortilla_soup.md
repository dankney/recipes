# Vegetarian Tortilla Soup

### Ingredients:

- 1 large white onion
- 28oz can Crushed Tomatoes
- 2 medium red bell pepers
- 1 small can diced green peppers
- 1 can whole kernel corn
- 2 quarts vegetable stock (or equivilent combination of soup starter and water)
- 8-16 oz water
- 1 bag of tortilla strips or chips
- 1-2 cups crumbled queso fresco (optional)

Chop the onion finely and the peppers coarsely. Hold the water in reserve and cook the remaining ingredients in a crock pot and cook on high for eight hours, stirring occasionally.

A significant amount of liquid will boil off during this time. Taste the soup as it cooks; if it starts to get too "tangy" add water to taste.

To serve, fill half of each bowl with tortilla chips then add soup. Garnish with queso fresco to taste.
