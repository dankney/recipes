# Mahammura

Mahammura is a easy Turkish meze. It's a slightly sweet, spicy red pepper and walnut dip that's incredibly delicious.

### Ingredients:

- 2 Large Red Bell Peppers
- 1 Cup Walnuts
- 1/3 Cup Bread Crumbs
- 1Tbsp Minced Garlic
- ½ Tsp Sea salt
- 1 Tsp Cumin
- 1/2 Tsp Ceyanne Pepper
- ¼ cup Olive Oil
- 1 tbsp Lemon Jiuce
- 2 TBSP Pomegranate Molassus

Start by roasting and peeling the bell peppers via your favorite technique.

Set the roasted peppers aside to cool. In the meantime, put the rest of the ingredients into your food processor in order, blending them as you go. Add the peppers for last and blend until smooth. Refrigerate for two hours or until chilled.

You're looking for a slightly firm texture. If the mixture seems runny, add additional walnuts. It will set as it cools in the fridge, so you're looking for yoghurt firmness rather than hummus firmness.
